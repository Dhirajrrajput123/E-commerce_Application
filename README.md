## Video Walkthrough of the project

## Key components of the project:

- Java: The programming language used to write the backend code, providing the necessary logic and algorithms to power the e-commerce platform.

- Spring Boot: A framework that simplifies the setup and development of Java-based applications. It offers various modules that streamline the development process and 
  handle common tasks, such as dependency injection, security, and web services.

- MySQL: A relational database management system used to store and manage various aspects of the e-commerce application, such as product information, user data, orders, 
  and other relevant data.

- API Endpoints: The backend exposes a set of API endpoints that the frontend can use to interact with the application. These endpoints handle actions like retrieving 
  product information, processing orders, managing user accounts, and more.

- User Authentication and Authorization: The backend ensures secure access to the application by implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms. It manages 
  user login, registration, and permissions to perform certain actions.

- Product and Order Management: The backend handles tasks related to product management, such as adding new products, updating their details, and managing inventory. It 
  also processes customer orders, verifies payments, and updates order statuses.

- Database Interaction: The backend communicates with the MySQL database to store and retrieve data. It uses Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API) to simplify the 
  interaction between the Java application and the database.

- Security: The project implements security measures to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and defend against common web vulnerabilities.
